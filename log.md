# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 25, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: leetcode medium problem - Insert Interval,K Closest Points to Origin

**Thoughts:** took some time to code but got it after some tries. 
  - Need to work on inproving time complexity
  - Need to work on thinking about corner cases.

### Day 2: July 26, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: leetcode medium/easy problem - 3Sum,2Sum

**Thoughts:** already solved these problems about a year back and now made the same mistakes again in 3sum and 2sum that i had made a year back 
  - Need to work on thinking about corner cases.
  - if you have to make something unique dont always go with set think of other possible solutions to improve complexity
